#Apache Flex

We will be using Apache Flex

## Installation Instructions ##

The Ant-based installer doesn't require AIR to be installed, or use the installer app, and is the preferred method of install on Linux.

	wget https://builds.apache.org/job/flex-sdk_release/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/out/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin.tar.gz
	
	tar zxvf apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin.tar.gz
	

	mv apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin flex
	cd flex
	ant -f installer.xml -Dair.sdk.version=2.6
	
You will be asked to agree to all the licence terms.
Now you just need to create folders to hold the player global file, and download the expected version:

	mkdir -p frameworks/libs/player/11.1/
	wget http://download.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/updaters/11/playerglobal11_1.swc -O frameworks/libs/player/11.1/playerglobal.swc
And finally verify that the Apache Flex compiler runs.

	bin/mxmlc


ArrayCollection
===============

Flex Adobe does not support  JSON.stringify on mx:ArrayCollection. That is the reason why MailDC uses Apache Flex.
