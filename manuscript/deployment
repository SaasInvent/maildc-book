## Workflow : dev to prod ##

This document holds all the information necessary for déploying my web-application : 

 - from developpment server to
 - production server

## Development ##

Development is done on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

On my Amazon server there are two principal directories

- the "dev" directory
- a main development directory

The purpose of the "main development directory" is to do the development.
The "dev" directory holds the data to be transferred. Any config data needs to be adapted before transfer.

The */home/ubuntu/dev* directory is organized as follows

/dev/workingbox
/dev/scripts (for transfert to prod server)


Production
----------

The production server has enough space for several versions of our web-applications.

We'll create the following directories

- /www/vers01
- /www.vers02

and so on..

The Amazon development platform has not enough space for all the different versions.


Transfer scripts
----------------

The transfer scripts are in the following directory

    /dev/scripts

Transfer is done via rsync. Below an example script:

to update the server's time, use sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com 	   

> "hash"!/bin/sh  
> rsync -avz --delete-after -e  "ssh -i keys"
> /home/ubuntu/dev/wkb-main-web-site/ workingbox@server_ip:/home/workingbox/www-v0.2
> exit 0

Workflow
-------

 1. rsync to dev (rsyncToDevMain.sh)
 2. modify dev (config data)
 3. rsync to prod
 4. repair glyphicons (on prod server)

The last point is a quirk of Bootstrap : it needs the glyphicons in the css subfolder.

This is why I'll create a symbolic link in my css directory:

    cd to css directory
    
    ln -s /address/where/glyphicons_are glyphicons

    ln -s /home/ubuntu/workingbox/wkb-web-site-0.8/assets/fonts/ glyphicons


## Troubleshooting ##

You might think about changing the glyphicons directory.

The server time is also worth mentioning. To update server time on Ubuntu do the following
You may manually sync the clock using the following

    sudo ntpdate servername

where servername can be any public or private time server. You may always choose the following without hesitation

    sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org

If you don’t have ntpdate installed, you can install it via:

    sudo aptitude install ntpdate
