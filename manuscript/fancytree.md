#Fancytree

[Fancytree](https://github.com/mar10/fancytree)  is a tree plugin for jQuery with support for persistence, keyboard, check-boxes, tables (grid), drag'n'drop, and lazy loading.

The tree data is stored in an array of nested objects. For example



    source: [
    {title: "Node 1", key: "1"},
    {title: "Folder 2", key: "2", folder: true, children: [
      {title: "Node 2.1", key: "3"},
      {title: "Node 2.2", key: "4"}
    ]}
    ],
    ...
