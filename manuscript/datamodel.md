#Data Model

The MailDC data model mimics the classic functionality of an email client

**MailDC should be able to handle emails that you store in folders.**

It should be that simple, no need for a complicated UML schema!

In an OOP approach we should create two classes:

 - Folder
 - Email

In a later version we might develop an address book using the ldif/vcard format.
