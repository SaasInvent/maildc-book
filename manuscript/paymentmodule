#Online payment module

MailDC is a paying service, although we strive to make it as less expensive as possible.

A fee of *9â‚¬45 per year* seems reasonable. The marketing department would have put it this way : *less than one euro per month*!

The payment provider is ["PayPlug"](https://www.payplug.fr/en/). Unfortunately there is no node module available for that platform.

So we're going to write our own!

Writing a npm module
--------------------

To get started, I created a new repository on my Github account and then cloned it locally.

*Configure npm*
Let's get started by configuring npm a little bit. Go ahead and enter these commands in a terminal, using your own information. This way, when we run some npm commands later, it will already know who we are and will be able to autocomplete some information for us.

    npm set init.author.name "WorkingBox"
    npm set init.author.email "contact@working-box.com"
    npm set init.author.url "http://www.working-box.com"

This next command will prompt you for an email and password, create or verify a user in the npm registry, and save the credentials to the ~/.npmrc file.

    npm adduser
