#Introduction

MailDC is a decentralized mail client based on the following principles:

 *  no mails are stored on a centralized server
 * every email is encrypted
 * your mails are stored on your computer in flash cookies
 * it is your responsibility to secure the access to your computer

If you are fine with these options, then read on!

Put it the other way around, MailDC addresses the following threats:

 1. the server is insecure
 2. the transmission is insecure
 3. your email is not encrypted

In order to be able to achieve this, it is necessary that each MailDC user accepts to forward messages addressed to another MailDC user : emails have to be relayed for receivers that are not online the moment the sender sent their message!

MailDC is an open source project. This will grant access for everyone to the source code. 

This book is not a user manual. It is rather a technical journal, its audience is 

 - security experts
 - web developers

Only a well documented project is guaranteed to be accepted by a large community of users.
