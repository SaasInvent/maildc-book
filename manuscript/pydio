First we need to ensure that Apache web server is installed


Apache
------

In order to know your server's IP address, simply login to your router and go to the client listing.
Then ssh into your server; in my case

ssh hexa-video-one@192.168.1.102

To remember the user, I create for each machine a user with the machine name. 

Then, as root, apt-get install apache2

http://192.168.1.102

Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 192.168.1.4. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message

This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems. It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache packaging is derived. If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at /var/www/html/index.html) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.


### DEB packages Installation (Debian,  Ubuntu)

You’ll have to manually append the following lines in your /etc/apt/sources.list file :

deb http://dl.ajaxplorer.info/repos/apt stable main
deb-src http://dl.ajaxplorer.info/repos/apt stable main
NOTE : If you want to install the “dev” release, you can use the deb “testing” distribution instead of “stable”, which would change the sources.list entry to

deb http://dl.ajaxplorer.info/repos/apt testing main
deb-src http://dl.ajaxplorer.info/repos/apt testing main
Then you have to install the public key using the following command :

wget -O - http://dl.ajaxplorer.info/repos/charles@ajaxplorer.info.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
Finally, update the apt-get database and install pydio :

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pydio
Copy the apache config sample :

 sudo cp /usr/share/doc/pydio/apache2.sample.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/pydio.conf
 sudo a2ensite pydio
 # Enable mod_rewrite
 sudo a2enmod rewrite
 # On Ubuntu 14, you may have to manually enable mcrypt
 php5enmod mcrypt
Now restart Apache, then open http://localhost/pydio.
When you are asked for updating the .htaccess file at the end of the install, you’ll find the file under /usr/share/pydio/.htaccess


Pydio recommends to disable the output buffering of PHP for improved performances. When doing a fresh install, you should get the following message:

you should disable php output_buffering for better performances with pydio.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to do that on Ubuntu using Apache2:

In /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini find this line:


    output_buffering = 4096

And replace it by:

    output_buffering = Off




Apache port configuration

Where is Apache listening?

    netstat -ntpl

We need to modify the following file:

    “/etc/apache2/ports.conf” 
If you just change the port or add more ports here, you will likely also
have to change the VirtualHost statement in

*/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf*

    Listen 8080
